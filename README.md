# SimpleTimer

A minimal, delay-free, millis-based software timer library for Arduino.
Designed for learning event-driven, cooperative-style timing and building small non-blocking applications.

## Features

- Simple, lightweight, no delay() usage
- Works with multiple timers independently
- Overflow-safe timing using `millis()`
- Perfect for learning kernel-like timing concepts
